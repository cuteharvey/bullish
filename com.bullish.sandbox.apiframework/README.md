This is a sample cucumber framework in Java to test Student api.

## What are included
- Cucumber test framework using Java
- Happy path test to /studentmgmt/fetchStudents endpoint
- HTML report in /target/Destination folder that you can open in browser (formatting can be improved)

## What are not included (TODOs)
- More checkpoints to happy path test
- Negative testing
- Boundary testing, Edge cases
- Tests for other endpoints

## NOTES
1. At least 1 student record exists in DB for test to pass. (I've used swagger to insert student record on my local)
2. I used IntelliJ to build this. I've only run the FetchStudentTest in IntelliJ. It works, test passed.
3. I have not used Cucumber before so most of my time was spent learning cucumber, doing a lot of google searching
3. I have not used Java in about 8 years. I'm a bit rusty
4. I spent 4 hours on this takehome. It's the only spare time I have right now. I am spending some quality time with my family here in Europe.
5. If you have questions, or want to expand on the other topics and the other asks on this project that I didn't cover, we can talk about them.
